# House Price Prediction Using ML
This project builds and evaluates a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various property features. It covers data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The code is written in Python using popular data science libraries.

# Features

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing

2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

3. Model development using regression algorithms

4. Model evaluation with metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²)

5. Predicts prices based on attributes such as size, location, and condition
